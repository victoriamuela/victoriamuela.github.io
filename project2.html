  <h2>A place i would like to visit</h2>
  
    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"><li>australia</li></a> If I could choose any place in the world to visit, it would be to go Australia because of its wildlife and its beauty.</p>
  
  <h2>A person I admire<br>(past or present).</h2> 
  
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Styles">A person that I admire would be Harry Styles. I admire him because even though he got extremely famous at young age he never let the fame get to his head and he stayed humble. He was also called many names by many people and news articles but he never let it take a toll on him.</p>
